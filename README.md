Breakout and Pong

A quick one-week project to improve my gamedev skills, uploaded here as a "release", because that's part of my self-imposed challenge. Don't copy anything you see here, it's sloppy as hell. Also, since I used debug outlines for everything, the compiled version of the game (where these shapes are invisible) is essentially unplayable. If you for some reason want to play this game, you'll need to download godot 4.x and import it.
